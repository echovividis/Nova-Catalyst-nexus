The Vault of Borrowed Worlds: Thumbelina’s Adventure

Accessing and Loading the Game:
----------------------------------
1. Prepare the Game File:
   - Create a text-based file (e.g., .txt or .json) containing the game’s lore, gameplay mechanics, and prompts.
   - File Name: Vault_of_Borrowed_Worlds_Game_Lore.txt
   - Contents Include:
      - Structured game profile, lore fragments, gameplay mechanics, and prompts.

2. Upload the File to GPT:
   - Access your GPT system or platform.
   - Use the "Upload Context" or "Load File" feature to add the game file to the session.
   - Confirm that GPT recognizes the file by prompting:
      - "Can you load and use the Thumbelina-inspired game file I uploaded?"

3. Testing the Game in GPT:
   - Start with a simple introduction prompt to ensure everything is set up:
      - "Let’s play The Vault of Borrowed Worlds. I’m Emma. Start my journey!"
   - GPT should respond with the game’s intro:
      - "Welcome to the Vault of Borrowed Worlds, Emma! The glowing book lies open before you. Do you step inside?"

How to Interact with the Game:
----------------------------------
1. Exploration:
   - Ask GPT to guide you through the Vault, using NPC dialogue or gameplay prompts like:
      - "Gus says: ‘Push the spoon to make a bridge!’ What do you do?"

2. Choices and Lore:
   - Respond to GPT’s questions or lore fragments to advance the story or uncover secrets:
      - "I follow Finn’s crumb trail to the hidden gear!"

3. Gameplay Expansion:
   - Prompt GPT to create additional challenges or expand on puzzles:
      - "Can you add a new puzzle where I need to stack dice to climb a teacup?"

Enhancing the Experience:
----------------------------------
- Customize NPC Dialogue:
   - Modify or expand Gus, Millie, and Finn’s personalities to fit your style.
- Track Progress:
   - Ask GPT to track solved puzzles or collected lore fragments in real-time.

Tips for Setup:
----------------------------------
- Save this guide as a reference for future gameplay.
- Ensure your uploaded file has clear sections for lore, gameplay, and prompts to make it easier for GPT to process.
- If GPT seems stuck, prompt it by saying: "Start my Thumbelina-inspired game from the glowing book scene."

Enjoy your magical adventure, Emma!
