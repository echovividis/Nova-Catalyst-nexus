### How to Start the Quest

1. **Opening Scene - Roo’s Mission**
   - Roo begins her solo mission to infiltrate an enemy hideout. She uncovers:
     - A faint magical melody (Taylor’s trace).
     - A cryptic note from Taylor: *"Follow the echoes where time stands still. A song unfinished calls you near, but beware the silence—it hides the way."*
   - Roo immediately recognizes Taylor’s presence and sets out to find Pillowpantz, Matt, and Goose.

2. **The Reunion**
   - Roo interrupts the gang’s usual antics, delivering the news: *“I found her. Taylor’s alive. But if we don’t move fast, she won’t stay that way.”*
   - The group prepares for their journey, sharing quick banter and strategizing their next move.

3. **First Destination: The Bardic Shrine**
   - The team travels to the Bardic Shrine, following the first clue. Along the way, they encounter:
     - Fun exploration moments (solving puzzles left by Taylor).
     - Combat encounters (enemies trying to stop their progress).
     - Magical echoes of Taylor’s presence.

4. **Progressing the Story**
   - As they uncover more clues, the team learns about the *Lyre of Eternity* and Taylor’s connection to the Chrono Relics.
   - The journey takes them to the Bard’s Keep, where they face the rift and rescue Taylor.

### Tips for Running the Game

- **Encourage Creativity:** Allow players to come up with creative solutions to puzzles and challenges.
- **Build Suspense:** Use Taylor’s clues and lingering magic to keep the mystery alive until her dramatic rescue.
