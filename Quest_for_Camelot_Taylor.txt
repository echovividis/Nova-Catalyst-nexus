### **How to Begin**

**Play as Roo (Rogue):**
- Roo begins the mission wearing her iconic *X-Men Rogue* outfit, complete with the white streak of hair. She is sharp, focused, and ready to uncover the mystery behind Taylor’s disappearance.

### **Mission Objective**

**Find Taylor and Rescue Her from Camelot!**
- Taylor has disappeared while chasing the legend of the *Lyre of Eternity*—a powerful artifact tied to Camelot’s mythical legacy.
- Your mission is to uncover her trail, follow the clues, and reunite the team to bring her back.

### **The Setup**

**1. Roo’s Solo Mission:**
- Roo is infiltrating an enemy hideout when she discovers:
  - A faint, magical melody (Taylor’s bardic magic).
  - A cryptic note left by Taylor:  
    *"Follow the echoes where time stands still. Seek the halls where knights still dream, and a song can wake the king."*
- Roo recognizes Taylor’s presence and escapes the hideout, dodging traps and enemies.

**2. Reuniting the Team:**
- Roo finds Pillowpantz, Matt (Knight Dragon), and Goose, interrupting their antics to deliver the urgent news:
  - *“I found her. Taylor’s alive. But if we don’t move fast, she won’t stay that way.”*
- The team quickly prepares to follow Taylor’s trail, guided by Roo’s discoveries.

### **The Journey**

**Step 1: The Bardic Shrine**
- The team travels to the Bardic Shrine, where Taylor’s magic has left traces.
  - Solve puzzles tied to melodies and rhythms.
  - Defeat enemies protecting the shrine.
  - Discover a forgotten song that serves as a map to Camelot.

**Step 2: The Trials of Time**
- Face three trials on the way to Camelot:
  1. **The Past:** Solve a riddle tied to Taylor’s and Pillowpantz’s shared history at the magic school.
  2. **The Present:** A high-stakes battle requiring teamwork.
  3. **The Future:** A mysterious prophecy linked to the group’s destiny.

**Step 3: Entering Camelot**
- Camelot is a frozen-in-time kingdom, alive with music and magic. Taylor’s presence keeps the kingdom stable, but she’s trapped in the process.

### **The Climax**

**Final Battle in Camelot**
- Face the fallen knight who seeks to control the *Lyre of Eternity* to rewrite history.
- Roo’s stealth, Pillowpantz’s agility, Matt’s fiery strength, and Goose’s raw power all come together to defeat the villain.
- Taylor sings *“Looking Through Your Eyes”* to resonate with the Lyre and awaken Camelot, freeing herself in the process.

### **Aftermath**

**Reunion with Taylor**
- Taylor’s humor and charisma shine as she reunites with the group:
  - To Roo: *“You didn’t think I’d let you have all the fun, did you?”*
  - To Pillowpantz: *“Took you long enough. I was about to knight myself!”*
  - To Matt and Goose: *“I hope you brought snacks. This place doesn’t even have a proper tavern.”*
- Taylor is knighted as the *Bard of Time*, and the team sets off for their next adventure, leaving a revived Camelot behind.
